# Text-Based-Game
A text game going from room to room.
I made this game for a coding math class for college. The story is set after an apocalypse, and the hero needs to gather fragments of the souls of humanity and bring them together to fight the husk of humanity and combine the husk with the fragments in order to bring back humanity. Nier replicant was part of the inspiration for my story. This was just a basic project to use some python code with pycharm.
